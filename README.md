Project Name: League Fixture Generator
Overview:
This project involves the creation of a football league fixture for 19 teams, following a double-round robin format. The schedule will last for 38 weeks, with each team playing against every other team both home and away. Every week, one team will rest and not play a match. The fixtures will be saved in a text file and displayed on the screen.
